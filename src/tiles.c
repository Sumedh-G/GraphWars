* Use lagrange polynomials as a hashing function from points on a grid to indicies, via
* pre-computed coeffs using a Vandamonde matrix.
*
* Make On-Grid and Off-Grid tile structs and create a tile editor that takes a tilemap
* and compresses it into a hashable format to load into the game
*
* Add support to render the tiles onto the grid with reference to the camera, adding parallax
* physics etc.
